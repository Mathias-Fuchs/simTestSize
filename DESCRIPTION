Description: This package's purpose is to provide guidance to a researcher who
    is about to perform a simulation study that involves drawing artificial
    training data and assessing the method's performance on testing data drawn
    from the same distribution. The main function simTestSize takes a training
    algorithm as argument and outputs an estimator for the optimal test set
    size, together with a confidence interval. The package is based on theory
    that states that the optimal test set size is determined by a function of
    the ratio of the variances of the conditional error rates to the average
    variance across test observations.
